This repository is a comprehensive guide and reference for understanding fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. Each topic includes explanations, code implementations, and examples to illustrate how these concepts work.

ðŸš€Data Structures

Each data structure includes an explanation of its purpose, complexity (Big-O notation), and Python code for common operations.

1. Arrays
   
A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
Key operations: Access, Insertion, Deletion.
Example Code: Basic array manipulation, searching, sorting.

2. Linked Lists
   
A linear data structure in which elements are linked using pointers.
Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List.
Example Code: Insertion, deletion, traversal.

3. Stacks

A linear data structure following Last In, First Out (LIFO) order.
Key operations: Push, Pop, Peek.
Example Code: Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists.

4. Queues

A linear data structure following First In, First Out (FIFO) order.
Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue.
Example Code: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek operations.

5. Hash Tables

Stores key-value pairs and provides efficient data retrieval.
Key operations: Insert, Delete, Search.
Example Code: Hash functions, collision resolution methods (chaining, open addressing).

6. Trees

A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.
Types: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.
Example Code: Insertion, traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).

7. Graphs

A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted Graphs.
Example Code: Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal (DFS, BFS).

ðŸš€Algorithms

Each algorithm includes an explanation, Python code, and an analysis of its time and space complexity.

1. Sorting Algorithms
   
Sorting algorithms are used to reorder elements.
Common algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.
Example Code: Sorting arrays with different algorithms, comparing performance.

2. Searching Algorithms

Algorithms to find specific elements within data structures.
Types: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Example Code: Implementing and comparing search algorithms.

3. Dynamic Programming

A technique to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems.
Key problems: Knapsack, Fibonacci Sequence, Longest Common Subsequence.
Example Code: Recursive and iterative DP solutions.

4. Graph Algorithms

Algorithms designed to solve graph-related problems.
Common algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, A* search.
Example Code: Graph traversal, shortest path algorithms.
